# Astro Starter Kit

This project aims to be a great starting point for your Astro projects that need to interact with DatoCMS.

- 🔍 **Fully commented code** — Every file is commented and explained in detail, it will be impossible to get lost!
- 💯 **100% TypeScript** — Thanks to [gql.tada](https://gql-tada.0no.co/) every GraphQL query is fully typed, and your IDE will help you complete the GraphQL queries.
- 🛠️ **Minimal boilerplate** — The project is minimal and exposes only what is necessary to get started, without complicated models that need to be removed.
- 🚫 **Zero CSS** — There is only one CSS import, which you can remove to use your preferred CSS tool.
- 📝 **Full support for Draft Mode** — Your editors can always view the latest draft version of the content.
- ✏️ **Click-to-edit overlays** — Integrated [@datocms/content-link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@datocms/content-link) for intuitive content editing. Click on any content element on your website to instantly open the DatoCMS editor for that specific field.
- 🧩 **Plugin ready** — Full integration with the [Web Previews](https://www.datocms.com/marketplace/plugins/i/datocms-plugin-web-previews) plugin, including Visual Editing mode for seamless in-context editing, and [SEO/Readability Analysis](https://www.datocms.com/marketplace/plugins/i/datocms-plugin-seo-readability-analysis).
- 🔄 **DatoCMS's Real-time Updates API** — Your editors can see updated content instantly as soon as you save a new version on DatoCMS.
- 🌐 **SEO Metadata** — Full integration between Astro and the SEO settings coming from DatoCMS.
- 📦 Official CDA Client — Uses @datocms/cda-client for performant, type-safe GraphQL queries to the Content Delivery API.
- 🔒 Type-Safe CMA Client — Uses @datocms/cma-client with auto-generated types from your schema for full autocomplete and compile-time safety.

## How to use

### Quick start

1. [Create an account on DatoCMS](https://datocms.com).

2. Make sure that you have set up the [Github integration on Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/git/vercel-for-github).

3. Let DatoCMS set everything up for you clicking this button below:

[![Deploy with DatoCMS](https://dashboard.datocms.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://dashboard.datocms.com/deploy?repo=datocms%2Fastro-starter-kit%3Amain)

### Local setup

Once the setup of the project and repo is done, clone the repo locally.

#### Set up environment variables

Copy the sample .env file:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env
```

In your DatoCMS' project, go to the **Settings** menu at the top and click **API tokens**.

Copy the values of the following tokens into the specified environment variable:

- `DATOCMS_PUBLISHED_CONTENT_CDA_TOKEN`: CDA Only (Published)
- `DATOCMS_DRAFT_CONTENT_CDA_TOKEN`: CDA Only (Draft)
- `DATOCMS_CMA_TOKEN`: CMA Only (Read)
- `DATOCMS_BASE_EDITING_URL`: Your DatoCMS project URL (e.g., `https://your-project.admin.datocms.com`). This enables click-to-edit overlays that link content directly to the DatoCMS editor.

Then set both `SECRET_API_TOKEN` and `SIGNED_COOKIE_JWT_SECRET` by generating two different secure strings (you can use `openssl rand -hex 32` or any other cryptographically-secure random string generator):

- The `SECRET_API_TOKEN` will be used to safeguard all API routes from incoming requests from untrusted sources;
- The `SIGNED_COOKIE_JWT_SECRET` will be used to sign the Draft Mode cookies.

#### Run your project locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Your website should be up and running on [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321)!

#### Generate CMA types (optional)

To get full type-safety when working with the Content Management API:

```bash
npm run generate-cma-types
```

This generates TypeScript types from your DatoCMS schema in `src/lib/datocms/cma-types.ts`. Run this command again whenever your schema changes to keep types in sync.

See: [Type-safe development with TypeScript](https://www.datocms.com/docs/content-management-api/resources/item#type-safe-development-with-typescript)

## Click-to-edit overlays

This starter kit includes [@datocms/content-link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@datocms/content-link), which provides intuitive click-to-edit overlays for your content.

### How to use

When viewing your website in draft mode, **press and hold the Alt/Option key** to enable click-to-edit mode. Interactive overlays will appear on all editable content. Release the key to disable the overlays.

This feature works in two powerful ways:

### 1. Standalone website editing

Click on any content element to instantly open the DatoCMS editor for that specific field in a new tab. This makes it incredibly easy for editors to jump directly to the content they want to modify.

### 2. Web Previews plugin Visual Editing mode

When using the [Web Previews plugin](https://www.datocms.com/marketplace/plugins/i/datocms-plugin-web-previews) in Visual Editing mode, clicking on content opens the field editor in a side panel right next to your preview. The integration also enables:

- **In-plugin navigation**: Users can navigate to different URLs within the Visual mode interface (like a browser navigation bar), and the preview automatically updates to show the corresponding page
- **Synchronized state**: The preview and DatoCMS interface stay in perfect sync

This bidirectional communication is established automatically when your preview runs inside the Web Previews plugin—no additional configuration needed.

### How it works

The implementation consists of three parts:

1. **Data fetching** (`src/lib/datocms/executeQuery.ts:37`): When fetching draft content, the `contentLink: 'v1'` option embeds stega-encoded metadata into text fields
2. **ContentLink component** (`src/components/ContentLink/Component.astro`): Creates interactive overlays and handles the Web Previews plugin integration
3. **Layout integration** (`src/layouts/Layout.astro:55`): The ContentLink component is rendered only in draft mode

For more details, see the [package documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@datocms/content-link).

## VS Code

It is highly recommended to follow [these instructions](https://gql-tada.0no.co/get-started/installation#vscode-setup) for an optimal experience with Visual Studio Code, including features like diagnostics, auto-completions, and type hovers for GraphQL.
